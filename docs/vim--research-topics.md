# Vim Topics To Handle

## More on Modes

Worth googling "Introduction to Vim Modes" to learn more.

## Vim Plugins

Might be worth seeing how to make a plugin.

For example a tool to help with commenting within markdown fenced code sections.

## The dot Operator

This seems potentially useful. It can repeat previous changes to the buffer.
