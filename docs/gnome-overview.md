## Making Default Ubuntu Gnome Better

With the goal of making the default experience more like a tiling window
manager experience, especially with regard to window/workspace navigation,
refer to the following:

Some basic customizations:

* Under `Settings > Keyboard > Navigation` set 'Switch Windows Directly' to `super+space`

Now some relevant shortcuts:

```sh
ctrl+alt+t          launch new terminal instance
ctrl+alt+<arrow>    move to next/prev workspace
super+<arrow>       snap/release focus window
super+space         switch to next window in workspace
super               toggle workspace/window overview
fn+super+<arrow>    jump to first/last workspace
```
