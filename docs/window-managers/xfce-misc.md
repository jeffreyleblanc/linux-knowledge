## Adding a Program Launcher to the Dock

This seems harder than it needs to be, but this works:

1. Right click on the dock
    * Panel > Add New Items
2. Choose Launcher from the popup menu
3. Right click on the new Launcher icon in the dock
    * Chose properties
4. In the popup click the "+"
5. Search for the application you want
6. Click "Add"
7. Close the open popups

Then the launcher icon will switch to the program icon
