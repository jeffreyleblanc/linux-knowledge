# Todo

There is always tons to do, but initial things to add/update:

## Inbox

Master List of big topics:

* boot process
* login, getty, tty, etc
* file systems and mounting
* kernel vs userspace
* package management
    * snaps
    * flatpack
    * deb, rpm, yum, etc...


## Strucure

The goal is not have an overly complicated structure, but perhaps a pattern of:

`<category>--<topic>`, e.g. `networking--nmcli.md` works.

So what categories are there?

```
bash--
networking--
filesys--
users--
core--
wm--  (for window manager, graphics?)
```
