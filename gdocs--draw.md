# Google Docs Drawings

In the search for a useable graphics generating program, it turns out Google Drawings are pretty decent:

* Good balance of features
* Widely available
* Inherently collaborative

To make one, some steps to follow:

* From drive you can `New > More > Google Drawings`
* To adjust the drawing size: `File > Page Setup > 16:9`
* To get a svg file: `File > Download > SVG`

A few other notes:

* Text works decently well as blocks when align center
* Gdocs is aggresive about turning `* text...` into a bullet. You can hit `Shift Backspace` if that happens to revert to plain text.
