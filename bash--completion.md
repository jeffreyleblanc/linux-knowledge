# Bash Completion

Bash completion provides command line completion for commands and paths.
Many programs (`pass` as an example) supply completion scripts for themselves.

Usually completion is picked up / iniiated from `~/.bashrc` which is often
looking for `/usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion` as an entry point.

To make sure you have bash completion enable you can:

```sh
$ apt-get install bash-completion
```
