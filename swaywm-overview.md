## Setup

```sh
$ apt-get install sway
$ mkdir ~/.config/sway
$ cp /etc/sway/config ~/.config/sway
```

I make the following updates to the config file:

```sh
# Your preferred terminal emulator
#orig set $term foot
set $term gnome-terminal

#
# Workspaces:
#
    # --snip--

    #custom: Add moving workspaces
    bindsym Control+Alt+Left workspace prev
    bindsym Control+Alt+Right workspace next
```
