# GUI File Browsers

Two main ones I use are:

* nautilus (GNOME)
* dolphin (KDE)

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install nautilus dolphin
```

I think nautilus is overall better, but dolphin has nicer thumbnails for images, pdf, and movies.


## Nautilus Key mappings

This goes for other file browsers as well:

```sh
up arrow        Move up an item
down arrow      Move down an arrow
f2              start rename for item
                <enter> to confirm
```
