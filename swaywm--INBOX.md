## External Monitor

* When plug in the monitor, it make a new `n+1` workspace
* Mouse can be moved between them off screen edge
* What happens when unplug/replug:
    * Unplug: The workspace slots back into single screen order
    * Plug back in: The workspace goes back to the external monitor
* Note which display `Super d` brings up the program launcher on seems
  a little inconsistent
