# iPhone and Ubuntu

The following is on 23.04:

* Attach your iPhone via USB
* Your iPhone will ask if you trust the machine
* The iPhone will show up as a mounted device
* The images are accessible on the device in a series of month based folders

**NOTE** For the moment I'm just copying out... I'm not sure you want to delete files via this method.

Also, apparently you can use `gthumb` to pull files off, though I like the directness of the above.
